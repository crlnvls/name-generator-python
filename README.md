# Python Exercise - Name Generator
- Make a `name_generator` module with two methods
  - `dragon_name` 
    - takes a person's first name and month of birth
    - returns their dragon name (you decide how this is formed!)
  - `penguin_name` 
    - takes a person's first name and month of birth
    - returns their penguin name (you decide how this is formed!)


- Make an `app.py` file that runs a game loop
  - User is asked if they want their dragon name or penguin name
  - User is asked for their name and month of birth
  - User is shown their new name!
  - User stays in game until they decide to leave
  - User can type in `exit` at the start to exit the program
